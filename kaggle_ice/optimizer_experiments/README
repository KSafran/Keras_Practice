This folder is for running some experiments on an AWS GPU.

I experiment with different optimizers (Adam and RMSprop) and with different 
learning rates. It looks like RMSprop with a learninig rate of 0.001 or so is 
best. I also need to be a bit more patient with the early stopping, the 
validation errors are fairly volatile. Now I'll move on and do some more
experimenting with the CNN architecture.

Directions for setting up AWS experiment

1. Compress this folder to make transportation easier
2. Start up an EC2 intance, g2.2xlarge has a GPU on it, and is fairly cheap. Use
the 'deep learning amazon linux AMI'. This has keras, tensorflow, and GPU support
3. Use git bash to ssh into the EC2 instance. Your command will look something like
this. 'ssh -i path/to/key.pem ec2-user@my_ec2_instance'
4. activate the tensorflow_p36 environment 'source activate anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36'
5. use another git bash window to scp the zipped training folder onto the gpu using 
the following 'scp -i path/to/key.pem path/to/zipped_folder.zip ec2-user@my_ec2_instance:~/'
6. run the code on the EC2 instance
7. send the results back to your computer 'scp -i path/to/key.pem 
ec2-user@my_ec2_instance:~/project/data/*.csv ~/Desktop'
8. Terminate your EC2 instance before you're out of money
